    <string name="general_information">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease
        caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.\n\nMost people infected with the COVID-19 virus will
        experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
        Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
        and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
        informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</string>
    <string name="preventions">To prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n
○ Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.\n
○ Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n
○ Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.\n
○ Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.\n
○ Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n
○ Stay home if you feel unwell.\n
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</string>
